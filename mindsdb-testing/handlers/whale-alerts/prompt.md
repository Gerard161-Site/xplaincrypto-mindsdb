## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Whale Alert API Integration
```sql
-- Primary Handler Configuration
CREATE DATABASE whale_alert_db
WITH ENGINE = 'http',
PARAMETERS = {
    "base_url": "https://api.whale-alert.io/v1",
    "headers": {
        "X-WA-API-KEY": "YOUR_WHALE_ALERT_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "timeout": 30,
    "retries": 3
};
```

### Key Data Endpoints
1. **Transactions** (`/transactions`) - Large cryptocurrency transactions
2. **Status** (`/status`) - API status and limits
3. **Blockchains** (`/blockchains`) - Supported blockchain networks
4. **Transaction Details** (`/transaction/{blockchain}/{hash}`)

### Critical Views to Implement
```sql
-- Large transactions monitoring
CREATE VIEW whale_transactions AS (
    SELECT blockchain, symbol, amount, amount_usd,
           from_address, to_address, timestamp, transaction_type,
           from_owner, to_owner, from_owner_type, to_owner_type
    FROM whale_alert_db.transactions
    WHERE amount_usd > 1000000
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
);

-- Exchange flows analysis
CREATE VIEW exchange_flows AS (
    SELECT blockchain, symbol, amount_usd, timestamp,
           CASE 
             WHEN to_owner_type = 'exchange' THEN 'Inflow'
             WHEN from_owner_type = 'exchange' THEN 'Outflow'
             ELSE 'Internal'
           END as flow_direction,
           COALESCE(from_owner, to_owner) as exchange_name
    FROM whale_alert_db.transactions
    WHERE from_owner_type = 'exchange' OR to_owner_type = 'exchange'
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
);

-- Whale activity summary
CREATE VIEW whale_activity AS (
    SELECT DATE(FROM_UNIXTIME(timestamp)) as date,
           blockchain, symbol,
           COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
           SUM(amount_usd) as total_volume_usd,
           AVG(amount_usd) as avg_transaction_usd,
           MAX(amount_usd) as largest_transaction_usd
    FROM whale_alert_db.transactions
    WHERE amount_usd > 500000
    GROUP BY DATE(FROM_UNIXTIME(timestamp)), blockchain, symbol
    ORDER BY date DESC, total_volume_usd DESC
);
```

       END as transaction_category
FROM whale_alert_db.transactions
WHERE timestamp > UNIX_TIMESTAMP(NOW() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
ORDER BY amount_usd DESC;
```

### 2. Exchange Flow Analysis
```sql
-- Exchange inflow/outflow monitoring
SELECT 
    DATE(FROM_UNIXTIME(timestamp)) as date,
    COALESCE(from_owner, to_owner) as exchange,
    symbol,
    SUM(CASE WHEN to_owner_type = 'exchange' THEN amount_usd ELSE 0 END) as inflow_usd,
    SUM(CASE WHEN from_owner_type = 'exchange' THEN amount_usd ELSE 0 END) as outflow_usd,
    (SUM(CASE WHEN to_owner_type = 'exchange' THEN amount_usd ELSE 0 END) - 
     SUM(CASE WHEN from_owner_type = 'exchange' THEN amount_usd ELSE 0 END)) as net_flow_usd
FROM whale_alert_db.transactions
WHERE (from_owner_type = 'exchange' OR to_owner_type = 'exchange')
  AND timestamp > UNIX_TIMESTAMP(NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(FROM_UNIXTIME(timestamp)), COALESCE(from_owner, to_owner), symbol
ORDER BY date DESC, ABS(net_flow_usd) DESC;
```

       from_owner, to_owner, from_owner_type, to_owner_type,
       CASE 
         WHEN from_owner_type = 'exchange' AND amount_usd > 5000000 THEN 'Large Exchange Outflow - Potential Selling Pressure'
         WHEN to_owner_type = 'exchange' AND amount_usd > 5000000 THEN 'Large Exchange Inflow - Potential Selling Pressure'
         WHEN from_owner_type = 'unknown' AND to_owner_type = 'unknown' AND amount_usd > 10000000 THEN 'Large Whale-to-Whale Transfer'
         WHEN amount_usd > 20000000 THEN 'Mega Transaction - High Market Impact Potential'
         ELSE 'Large Transaction'
       END as impact_analysis
FROM whale_alert_db.transactions
WHERE amount_usd > 3000000
  AND timestamp > UNIX_TIMESTAMP(NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### 4. Institutional Activity Tracking
```sql
-- Institutional behavior patterns
SELECT from_owner, to_owner, from_owner_type, to_owner_type,
       symbol, COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
       SUM(amount_usd) as total_volume_usd,
       AVG(amount_usd) as avg_transaction_usd,
       MIN(timestamp) as first_transaction,
       MAX(timestamp) as last_transaction
FROM whale_alert_db.transactions
WHERE (from_owner_type IN ('exchange', 'wallet', 'defi') 
       OR to_owner_type IN ('exchange', 'wallet', 'defi'))
  AND amount_usd > 1000000
  AND timestamp > UNIX_TIMESTAMP(NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY from_owner, to_owner, from_owner_type, to_owner_type, symbol
HAVING transaction_count > 5
ORDER BY total_volume_usd DESC;
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide
