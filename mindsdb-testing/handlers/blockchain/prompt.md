https://github.com/Gerard161-Site/blockchain_handler.git
```

### Key Data Sources
1. **Block Data** (`/rawblock/{block_hash}`)
2. **Transaction Data** (`/rawtx/{tx_hash}`)
3. **Address Information** (`/rawaddr/{address}`)
4. **Network Statistics** (`/stats`)
5. **Unconfirmed Transactions** (`/unconfirmed-transactions`)

### Critical Views to Implement
```sql
-- Latest blocks with key metrics
CREATE VIEW latest_blocks AS (
    SELECT hash, height, time, n_tx, size, 
           prev_block, merkle_root, bits, nonce
    FROM blockchain_db.blocks
    ORDER BY height DESC
);

-- High-value transactions
CREATE VIEW large_transactions AS (
    SELECT hash, time, size, fee, 
           JSON_LENGTH(inputs) as input_count,
           JSON_LENGTH(out) as output_count,
           SUM(JSON_EXTRACT(out, '$[*].value')) as total_value
    FROM blockchain_db.transactions
    WHERE SUM(JSON_EXTRACT(out, '$[*].value')) > 100000000
    ORDER BY total_value DESC
);

-- Active addresses analysis
CREATE VIEW address_activity AS (
    SELECT address, final_balance, n_tx, 
           total_received, total_sent,
           (total_received - total_sent) as net_flow
    FROM blockchain_db.addresses

JOIN blockchain_db.stats s ON 1=1
WHERE b.height = (SELECT MAX(height) FROM blockchain_db.blocks);
```

### 2. Address Monitoring & Analytics
```sql
-- Whale address tracking
SELECT address, final_balance, n_tx, total_received,
       CASE 
         WHEN final_balance > 100000000000 THEN 'Mega Whale'
         WHEN final_balance > 10000000000 THEN 'Whale'
         WHEN final_balance > 1000000000 THEN 'Large Holder'
         ELSE 'Regular'
       END as holder_category
FROM blockchain_db.addresses
