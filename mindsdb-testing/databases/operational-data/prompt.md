Your database is the **operational nerve center** for:
- 24/7 system monitoring across all components
- Performance analytics for 1000+ API endpoints
- Error tracking and incident management
- Data pipeline health and reliability monitoring
- Automated alerting and escalation systems

## üîß Technical Specifications

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Missing System Metrics
```sql
-- Solution: Identify components with stale metrics
SELECT component, MAX(timestamp) as last_metric,
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, MAX(timestamp), NOW()) as minutes_stale
FROM system_metrics
GROUP BY component
HAVING minutes_stale > 10
ORDER BY minutes_stale DESC;
```

**Issue**: High Error Rates
```sql
-- Solution: Analyze error patterns and root causes
SELECT component, error_code, COUNT(*) as error_count,
       MIN(timestamp) as first_occurrence,
       MAX(timestamp) as last_occurrence,
       GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT error_message ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 3) as recent_messages
FROM error_logs
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY component, error_code
ORDER BY error_count DESC;
```

**Issue**: Performance Degradation
```sql
-- Solution: Identify performance bottlenecks
SELECT endpoint, method,
       COUNT(*) as request_count,
       AVG(response_time_ms) as avg_response_time,
       MAX(response_time_ms) as max_response_time,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY response_time_ms) as p95_response_time
FROM api_usage
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
  AND response_time_ms > 1000
GROUP BY endpoint, method
ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC;
```
