## 🔍 Validation & Testing Strategy

### Data Integrity Tests
```sql
-- Test 1: Price data consistency
SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM price_data
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY symbol, timestamp
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Test 2: Market cap calculations
SELECT symbol, price, market_cap,
       (price * circulating_supply) as calculated_market_cap
FROM latest_prices
WHERE ABS(market_cap - (price * circulating_supply)) > market_cap * 0.01;

-- Test 3: DeFi protocol data validation
SELECT protocol_name, COUNT(*) as records,
       MIN(timestamp) as first_record,
       MAX(timestamp) as last_record
FROM defi_protocols
GROUP BY protocol_name
HAVING COUNT(*) = 0;
```

### Performance Tests
```sql
-- Query performance benchmarks
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM latest_prices WHERE symbol = 'BTC';
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM top_defi_protocols ORDER BY current_tvl DESC;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM recent_whale_activity WHERE amount_usd > 1000000;
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Slow Query Performance
```sql
-- Solution: Analyze and optimize indexes
SHOW INDEX FROM price_data;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM price_data WHERE symbol = 'BTC' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 100;

-- Add missing indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_symbol_timestamp ON price_data(symbol, timestamp);
```

**Issue**: Data Inconsistency
```sql
-- Solution: Implement data validation checks
SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) as duplicate_timestamps
FROM price_data 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY symbol, timestamp
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Issue**: Storage Growth
```sql
-- Solution: Implement data archiving
-- Archive old price data (keep last 90 days in main table)
CREATE TABLE price_data_archive LIKE price_data;
INSERT INTO price_data_archive 
SELECT * FROM price_data 
WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL 90 DAY;
DELETE FROM price_data 
WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL 90 DAY;
```
