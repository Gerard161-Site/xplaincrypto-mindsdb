## üîß Technical Specifications

### Dune Analytics API Integration
```
-- Primary Handler Configuration
https://github.com/Gerard161-Site/dune_handler.git
```

### Key Data Endpoints
1. **Query Execution** (`/query/{query_id}/execute`)

    ORDER BY tvl_usd DESC
);

-- NFT marketplace analytics
CREATE VIEW nft_marketplace_stats AS (
    SELECT marketplace, volume_eth, volume_usd, 
           sales_count, unique_buyers, unique_sellers,
