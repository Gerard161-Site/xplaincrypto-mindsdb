## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Binance API Integration
https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/main/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/binance_handler
```sql
-- Primary Handler Configuration
CREATE DATABASE my_binance
WITH
  ENGINE = 'binance'
  PARAMETERS = {};

```

### Key Data Sources
1. **24hr Ticker Statistics** (`/api/v3/ticker/24hr`)
2. **Order Book** (`/api/v3/depth`)
3. **Recent Trades** (`/api/v3/trades`)
4. **Kline/Candlestick Data** (`/api/v3/klines`)
5. **Exchange Information** (`/api/v3/exchangeInfo`)

### Critical Views to Implement
```sql
-- Major trading pairs with volume
CREATE VIEW major_pairs AS (
    SELECT symbol, price, volume, priceChangePercent, 
           high, low, openPrice, prevClosePrice
    FROM binance_db.tickers
    WHERE volume > 1000000 AND symbol LIKE '%USDT'
    ORDER BY volume DESC
);

-- Market depth analysis
CREATE VIEW market_depth AS (
    SELECT symbol, 
           JSON_EXTRACT(bids, '$[0][0]') as best_bid,
           JSON_EXTRACT(asks, '$[0][0]') as best_ask,
           (JSON_EXTRACT(asks, '$[0][0]') - JSON_EXTRACT(bids, '$[0][0]')) as spread
    FROM binance_db.orderbook
    WHERE symbol IN ('BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'BNBUSDT');

-- High volatility pairs
CREATE VIEW volatile_pairs AS (
    SELECT symbol, price, priceChangePercent, volume
    FROM binance_db.tickers
    WHERE ABS(priceChangePercent) > 5 AND volume > 500000
    ORDER BY ABS(priceChangePercent) DESC
);
```

WHERE symbol IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT symbol FROM user_watchlists 
    WHERE user_id = ?
)
ORDER BY volume DESC;
```

### 2. Market Depth Analysis
```sql
-- Order book analysis for trading insights
SELECT symbol,

       JSON_EXTRACT(bids, '$[0][1]') as best_bid_qty,
       JSON_EXTRACT(asks, '$[0][0]') as best_ask_price,
       JSON_EXTRACT(asks, '$[0][1]') as best_ask_qty,
       (JSON_EXTRACT(asks, '$[0][0]') - JSON_EXTRACT(bids, '$[0][0]')) / JSON_EXTRACT(bids, '$[0][0]') * 100 as spread_percent
FROM binance_db.orderbook
WHERE symbol IN ('BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'BNBUSDT');
```

### 3. Volume and Liquidity Analysis
```sql
-- High-volume trading opportunities
SELECT symbol, price, volume, priceChangePercent,
       CASE 
         WHEN volume > 100000000 THEN 'Very High'
         WHEN volume > 50000000 THEN 'High'
         WHEN volume > 10000000 THEN 'Medium'
         ELSE 'Low'
       END as liquidity_tier
FROM binance_db.tickers
WHERE volume > 5000000
ORDER BY volume DESC;
```

### 4. Volatility Monitoring
```sql
-- Volatility alerts and opportunities
SELECT symbol, price, priceChangePercent, volume,
       ABS(priceChangePercent) as volatility,
       CASE 
         WHEN ABS(priceChangePercent) > 20 THEN 'Extreme'
         WHEN ABS(priceChangePercent) > 10 THEN 'High'
         WHEN ABS(priceChangePercent) > 5 THEN 'Moderate'
         ELSE 'Low'
       END as volatility_level
FROM binance_db.tickers
WHERE ABS(priceChangePercent) > 3 AND volume > 1000000
ORDER BY ABS(priceChangePercent) DESC;
```
